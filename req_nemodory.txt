MODEL REQUIREMENTS FOR NEMO EXPORT & DORY USAGE

NEMO:
- channels must be multiple of 4 (even 1, 2, and 3 are wrong)
- linear layers (Conv and FC) must have no bias: bias=False
- conv-bn-relu
- BatchNorms must not be folded
- quantization must be 8-bit for activations, and 7-bit for weights (due to asymmetry)
- the model to be exported is the Integer Deployable (ID)
- input & activations must be exported from ID model via the function nemo.utils.get_intermediate_activations,
  NOT via nemo.utils.get_integer_activations

DORY
- if "--Bn_Relu_Bits 32" (default) does not work, try also "--Bn_Relu_Bits 64"
- currently, checksums on weights using L3 fail even if the model is correct
